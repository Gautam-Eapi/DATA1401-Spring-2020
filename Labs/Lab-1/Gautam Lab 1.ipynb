It is clearly not in your working directory, because you didn't see it when you executed \"ls\". We can ask the shell to tell us where it found \"ls\" using the \"which ls\" command.

You may be able to guess what some of these programs do, but if you want to know, most of them provide you help, using \"--help\" or \"-h\" flag. For example execute \"ls --help\". For more information about a program or command, you can use Unix's manual pages using the \"man\" command. Try typing \"man ls\".

An instance of `git` server stores repositories, each typically containing the code relevant to a specific project. Users create local `clones` of repositories, change and develop the local copies of the code, `commit` the changes to their local repository, `push` to the server as a contribution,  \n","`pull` updates from the server, and `merge` changes between local and remote versions. \n","\n","Besides cloning, repositories can be branched or forked. A repository generally starts with a `master` branch that evolves as push requests are merged in. Creating a new branch from an existing branch creates a snapshot of the which can evolve independently or be merged in later. Branches are easy to make and delete, and can serve various purposes. They can represent a stable version of software package. Or a parallel development for different operating system.
